<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Microcontroller output source is +3.3v to +5.0v and 25Ma to 45ma through their input or output pins. This voltage and current is not enough to high voltage load uses. So we use IRFZ44N MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect Transistor) used to produce high voltage load through microcontroller. IRFZ44N MOSFET
is a N-channel MOSFET. It has high speed switching capability. It is used in application like high speed switching. 

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>

We using this MOSFET for application in our project like Main parachute, Dough parachute and Rocket Motor. If we connect source and gate in negative, then drain is positive. It enhances the voltage. If we connect source and gate in positive, then drain is negative. it deflects the voltage.
